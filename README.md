# Estimate the abundance of minerals in the soil
In this repository, I'll explain how to use soil spectra to estimate the abundance of two minerals in the soil: hematite and goethite. Further, I'll use a satellite image to spatially predict these abundances and obtain the maps.  
This tutorial was given to a group of students from Tel Aviv University.
